Data Cleaning with ChatGPT and SQLite sandbox query

1. write a sql query that checks if the value is null or will throw an error and returns today's date instead of null or error. If there is no null or error, then return the original value in the database

2. write a python script to generate sample time series data to test that query; show the results side by side of the original date column with null and would-be error values side by side with the output of the query with all the null and error values cast to today's date instead
